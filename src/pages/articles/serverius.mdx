At this internship I got the change to test my cybersecurity skills. I got the assignment to test their WAF (Web Application Firewall). I got the freedom to test their system and make a report about what was blocked and what was let trough.

After that was done I've made some changes to their code and rule set in the WAF. When I was done with that I made a dashboard where you could talk to the CLI trough an API and make calls to the WAF from the dashboard online.
