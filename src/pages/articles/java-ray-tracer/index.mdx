I've build this raytracer with Java

The raytracer is inspired with the book Ray Tracing in a weekend

I've made an STL loader so the raytracer could load in any objects that you want. I've decided to make a render of the titanic.

In this project I've learned a lot about vectors and the math behind it. I've also learned how an raytracer renders a scene.
