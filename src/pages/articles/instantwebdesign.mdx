#Starting InstantWebdesign: From School Friends to Business Partners
When my friend and I were in school, we discovered our shared passion for web design. As we grew older, we realized that we could turn our hobby into a business. And so, we founded our own web design company called InstantWebdesign.

We began by creating a simple website to showcase our portfolio and services. We also reached out to potential clients, including small businesses and startups. While we faced some challenges in managing our time and communicating with clients, we remained committed to making our business work.

Currently, we have two clients, but we are excited to continue growing our business. We are proud of the work we have done for our clients and are committed to providing high-quality web design services.

Our goal is to continue expanding our portfolio, attracting new clients, and building our reputation as a trusted and reliable web design company.
